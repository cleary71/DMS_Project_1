Running buffer manager tests...

  Test 1 does a simple test of normal buffer manager operations:
  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
  - Write something on each one
  - Read that something back from each one
   (because we're buffering, this is where most of the writes happen)
  - Free the pages again
  Test 1 completed successfully.

  Test 2 exercises some illegal buffer manager operations:
  - Try to pin more pages than there are frames
  --> Failed as expected

  - Try to free a doubly-pinned page
  --> Failed as expected

  - Try to unpin a page not in the buffer pool
  --> Failed as expected

  Test 2 completed successfully.

  Test 3 exercises some of the internals of the buffer manager
  - Allocate and dirty some new pages, one at a time, and leave some pinned
  - Read the pages
  Test 3 completed successfully.

All buffer manager tests completed successfully!
